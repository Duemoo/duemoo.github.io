##### *Ph.D. Student*

###### *Graduate School of AI, KAIST*

<br />

Hello, I am a Ph.D. student in [Language & Knowledge Lab](https://lklab.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST Graduate School of AI. I am fortunate to be advised by [Minjoon Seo](https://seominjoon.github.io/). Before KAIST, I obtained a B.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Biological Sciences at Seoul National University.

<!--My research interests lie in natural language processing and neuro-symbolic AI. My focus lies in exploring how knowledge representations can be encoded, transferred, and utilized for inference and reasoning in AI models. I believe that gaining such insights can pave the way toward building more safe and reliable AI systems.-->
<!--My academic pursuit centers on understanding how intelligent systems acquire and process knowledge from intricate patterns. My recent focus is to understand the  the analysis of language models, aiming to uncover the methods through which knowledge representations are encoded, transferred, and leveraged for inference and reasoning within AI frameworks. Passionately, I engage in blending concepts from a diverse array of disciplines related to my academic goals, including computational neuroscience, philosophy, linguistics, and psychology, to cultivate a comprehensive understanding of artificial intelligence.-->
My academic goal is to understand the acquisition and processing of knowledge by intelligent systems from complex patterns. Specifically, my recent focus lies in analyzing language models to understand how they encode, transfer, and utilize knowledge for reasoning and inference. I am open and passionate about studying and integrating concepts from other fields involved in studying intelligence and knowledge (computational neuroscience, complex systems, philosophy, linguistics, psychology, etc.) to deepen my understanding of intelligent systems.
